CanYouReadThis
==============
I got this the other day in an email and thought I would see if I could duplicate such a thing in a plugin:
--------------------------------------
Only great minds can read this 
This is weird, but interesting!

fi yuo cna raed tihs, yuo hvae a sgtrane mnid too 
Cna yuo raed tihs? Olny 55 plepoe out of 100 can.. 

i cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid, aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it dseno't mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it whotuit a pboerlm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Azanmig huh? yaeh and I awlyas tghuhot slpeling was ipmorantt! if you can raed tihs forwrad it

Example
=======
Very simple, it is just a helper that you use in your view.

Use in your view like this:
<%= can_you_read_this("hello, my name is charlie") %>
<%= can_you_read_this(%|hey how are you doing?
  hello, hello, hello
  goodbye, goodbye, good bye|)
